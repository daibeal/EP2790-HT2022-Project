\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
\begin{quote}
    "When subcontractors obtain the same access rights as internal users..."
\end{quote}
\begin{justify}
In today's enterprises, working with subcontractors and outside vendors is the standard. Giving outsiders access to your network, however, may entail security threats.\\ \\
\textbf{Definition of third-party security breach} \\ \\
When a vendor's or business partner's computer system is "hacked" and sensitive information is made available, this is referred to as a third-party data breach. Cybercriminals may target any vendor in related to a company's ecosystem, and according to industry experts, third-party vendors account for around 60\% of all data breaches.

 \subsection{Volkswagen, Audi disclose data breach impacting over 3.3 million customers}
 \begin{justify}
 By hacking a vendor that Volkswagen dealers worked with for digital sales and marketing, hostile actors were able to access an unprotected critical data file, Volkswagen stated in May 2021. Over 3 million existing and future Audi customers were affected by the incident. 
While the majority of the compromised data simply included consumers' contact information and facts about the vehicle they had purchased or requested, about 90,000 customers also had their sensitive information exposed. Volkswagen responded by promising individuals impacted free credit protection services.

{\bf Notes:} 
A critical component of the work is the list of references. We have
discussed their use earlier -- here I simply make some notes on their
presentation. 

This is one of the hardest parts to get just right. BibTeX can help a
great deal, but you need to put a good deal of care in to make sure
that
\begin{itemize}
\item the references are in a consistent format;

\item all information is correct; and 

\item the information included is in the correct style for the
  intended audience.

\end{itemize}
Details \emph{really} matter in this section. It's easy to lose marks
in this section.
